Ye good olde Minecraft clone, this time using the [OLCPGE](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine).
Started writing it, gave up, bon appetit. Performance is terrible, graphics are wonky, collisions don't work well. Most of the code is actually copied from my SpaceCore project, so it might be a bit overkill.
